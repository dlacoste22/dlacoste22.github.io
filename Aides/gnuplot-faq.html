1.1 What is <B>gnuplot</B>?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<B>gnuplot</B> is a command-driven interactive function plotting
program. It can be used to plot functions and data points in
both two- and three-dimensional plots in many different
formats, and will accommodate many of the needs of today's
scientists for graphic data representation. <B>gnuplot</B> is
copyrighted, but freely distributable; you don't have to pay
for it.

<P>
This document deals with <B>gnuplot</B> Version 3.7 which is the
latest official release as of November 6, 2001. References to bug-fix
versions or (recent) beta versions are explicitly marked.

1.2 How did it come about and why is it called <B>gnuplot</B>?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The authors of <B>gnuplot</B> are:
Thomas Williams, Colin Kelley, Russell Lang, Dave Kotz, John
Campbell, Gershon Elber, Alexander Woo and many others.

<P>
The following quote comes from Thomas Williams:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was taking a differential equation class and Colin was taking
     Electromagnetics, we both thought it'd be helpful to visualize the
     mathematics behind them. We were both working as sys admin for an
     EE VLSI lab, so we had the graphics terminals and the time to do
     some coding. The posting was better received than we expected, and
     prompted us to add some, albeit lame, support for file data.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any reference to GNUplot is incorrect. The real name of the program
     is "<B>gnuplot</B>". You see people use "<B>gnuplot</B>" quite a bit because many
     of us have an aversion to starting a sentence with a lower case
     letter, even in the case of proper nouns and titles. <B>gnuplot</B> is not
     related to the GNU project or the FSF in any but the most
     peripheral sense. Our software was designed completely
     independently and the name "<B>gnuplot</B>" was actually a compromise. I
     wanted to call it "llamaplot" and Colin wanted to call it "nplot."
     We agreed that "newplot" was acceptable but, we then discovered
     that there was an absolutely ghastly pascal program of that name
     that the Computer Science Dept. occasionally used. I decided that
     "<B>gnuplot</B>" would make a nice pun and after a fashion Colin agreed.

For all intent and purpose, any description of what the codes are doing

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00038000000000000000">
1.8 Is <B>gnuplot</B> Y2K compliant?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<B>Gnuplot</B>'s compliance depends in part on the compliance of the underlying
operating system and hardware.  The only use <B>gnuplot</B> makes of a system-
supplied date is in the "set timestamp" command, which simply echos the
date on the plot.  If the underlying OS cannot produce an accurate time
string, then the "set timestamp" command may fail to print the correct
date on plots.

<P>
In <B>gnuplot</B> 3.5, if the user chooses to use %y in a timestamp format,
rather than %Y, it will print 2-digit rather than 4-digit years.  The
effects depend on the importance you place on the timestamps printed on
plots.

<P>
<B>Gnuplot</B> 3.7 also allows the use of time/date data as variables, but the
user has complete control over the input format of the data and the
output format of the tic labels - the same 2-digit "%y" (interpreted
as 1900+) and 4-digit "%Y" formats are both available.  But again,
these are user-specifiable, so if there is a Y2K problem here, it is the
responsibility of the user.

<P>
Of course, <B>gnuplot</B> is built by executing a makefile, which may well be
date-dependent.  So if the operating system has a Y2K problem, the
process of building a new executable of <B>gnuplot</B> may be affected.  But
that wouldn't be a problem with <B>gnuplot</B> per se.

<P>
<B>IMPORTANT NOTICE</B>

<P>
As of <B>gnuplot</B> beta version 3.7.0.9, the interpretation of the "%y" two
digit year specifier was changed in accordance with the recommendations
of The Open Group and all major Unix vendors.  When a century is not
otherwise specified, values in the range 69-99 refer to the twentieth
century and values in the range 00-68 refer to the twenty-first century.
Be very careful when interpreting 2-digit year expressions.

3.3 How do I include my graphs in &lt;word processor&gt;?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Basically, you save your plot to a file in a format your word
processor can understand (using "set term" and "set output",
see above), and then you read in the plot from your word
processor. Vector formats should be preferred, as you can scale
your graph later to the right size.

<P>
Details depend on the kind of word processor you use; use "set
term" to get a list of available file formats.

<P>
Many word processors can use Encapsulated PostScript for
graphs. This can be generated by the "set terminal postscript
eps" command. Most MS-DOS word processors understand HPGL
(terminal type hpgl).

<P>
With TeX, it depends on what you use to print your dvi files.
If you use dvips or dvi2ps, you can use Encapsulated
PostScript. For emTeX (popular for MS-DOSns OS/2), you can use emTeX,
otherwise use the L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X terminal type, which generates a
picture environment.

<P>
If nothing else helps, try using the pgm or ppm format and
converting it to a bitmap format your favourite word processor
can understand. An invaluable tool for this is Jef Poskanzer's
PBMPLUS package.

Implicit graphs or curves cannot be plotted directly in <B>gnuplot</B>.
However there is a workaround. 
<PRE>
gnuplot&gt; # as example. Place your definition in the following line
gnuplot&gt; f(x,y) = y - x**2 / tan(y)
gnuplot&gt; set contour base
gnuplot&gt; set cntrparam levels discrete 0.0
gnuplot&gt; set nosurface

<P>
First, try to see whether it actually is a bug, or whether it
is a feature which may be turned off by some obscure set-command.

<P>
Next, see whether you have an old version of <B>gnuplot</B>; if you do,
chances are the bug has been fixed in a newer release.

<P>
Fixes for bugs reported since the release of the current version are
held in the <TT>patches</TT> directory at <B>gnuplot</B> distribution sites.
Before submitting a bug report, please check whether the bug in question
has already been fixed.

<P>
If, after checking these things, you still are convinced that there is a
bug, proceed as follows. If you have a fairly general sort of bug
report, posting to &nbsp;~<A NAME="tex2html64"

terminal driver, operating system, an exact description of the bug and
input which can reproduce the bug. Failure to indicate these details can
render a solution to your problem almost impossible. Also, any context

6.1 How do I plot two functions in non-overlapping regions?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Use a parametric plot. An example:
<PRE>
gnuplot&gt; set parametric
gnuplot&gt; a=1
gnuplot&gt; b=3
gnuplot&gt; c=2
gnuplot&gt; d=4
gnuplot&gt; x1(t) = a+(b-a)*t
gnuplot&gt; x2(t) = c+(d-c)*t
gnuplot&gt; f1(x) = sin(x)
gnuplot&gt; f2(x) = x**2/8
gnuplot&gt; plot [t=0:1] x1(t),f1(x1(t)) title "f1", x2(t), f2(x2(t)) title "f2"
</PRE>

<P>
You can also use <B>gnuplot</B>'s ability to ignore mathematically undefined
expressions: the expression <code>1/0</code> is silently ignored, thus a
construction like
<PRE>
gnuplot&gt; set xran [-10:10]
gnuplot&gt; plot (abs(x)&gt;0.5?1/0: x**2)
</PRE>
plots a quadratic function only for <code>|x| &lt; 0.5</code>.

6.2 How do I run my data through a filter before plotting?</A>
</H2>

<P>
If your system supports the popen() function, as Unix does, you
should be able to run the output through another process, for
example a short awk program, such as

<P>
<PRE>
gnuplot&gt; plot "&lt; awk ' { print $1, $3/$2 } ' file.in"
</PRE>

<P>
The plot command is very powerful and is able to do some
arithmetic on datafiles. See "help plot".

6.3 How do I make it easier to use <B>gnuplot</B> with L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X?</A>
</H2>

<P>
There is a set of L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X macros and shell scripts that are meant
to make your life easier when using <B>gnuplot</B> with L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X. This
package can be found on <A NAME="tex2html88"
  HREF="ftp://ftp.dartmouth.edupub/gnuplot/latex.shar"><TT>ftp.dartmouth.edu</TT> in <TT>pub/gnuplot/latex.shar</TT></A>,
by David Kotz.
For example, the program "plotskel" can turn a gnuplot-output
file plot.tex into a skeleton file skel.tex, that has the same
size as the original plot but contains no graph. With the right
macros, the skeleton can be used for preliminary L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X passes,
reserving the full graph for later passes, saving tremendous
amounts of time.

6.5 How do I plot lines (not grids) using splot?</A>
</H2>

<P>
If the data in a data file for splot is arranged in such a way
that each one has the same number of data points (using blank
lines as delimiters, as usual), splot will plot the data with a
grid. If you want to plot just lines, use a different number of
data entries (you can do this by doubling the last data point,
for example). Don't forget to set parametric mode, of course.

6.8 How do I call <B>gnuplot</B> from my own programs?</A>
</H2>

<P>
There's a code which works for a UNIX system, using (efficient)
named pipes. On M$ Windows platforms, due to the lacking standard
input of GUI programs, you need to use the C-code <TT>pgnuplot</TT>
written by Hans-Bernhard Broeker
<A NAME="tex2html89"
  HREF="mailto:broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de"><TT>broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de</TT></A>. You can obtain this file on

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00089000000000000000">
6.9 What if I need h-bar (Planck's constant)?</A>
</H2>

<P>
There is no predefined variable like pi. However to put h-bar as
a character into the label, you must use the PostScript terminal.
You can play around with constructs like
<code> @{/=56 -} {/=24 h}</code> or
<code> {/=8 @{/Symbol=24 -} _{/=14 h}}</code>
In the latter, the "-" (a long one in /Symbol) is non-spacing and 24-pt.
The 14-pt "h" is offset by an 8-pt space (which is the space preceding
the "_") but smaller, since it's written as a subscript.
But these don't look too much like the hbar we're used to, since the bar
is horizontal instead of sloped.  I don't see a way to get that.  I
tried using an accent (
<BR>
264 in isoLatin encoding), but I haven't found a
way to scale and position the pieces correctly.

<P>
One more possibility would be
<code>{/=14 @^{/Symbol=10 -}{/=14 h}}</code>.

<P>
(This is a hint by Richard Crawford).

7.1 <B>Gnuplot</B> is not plotting any points under X11! How come?</A>
</H2>
On VMS, you need to make several symbols:

<P>
<PRE>
        $ gnuplot_x11 :== $disk:[directory]gnuplot_x11
        $ gnuplot :== $disk:[directory]gnuplot.exe
        $ def/job GNUPLOT$HELP disk:[directory]gnuplot.hlb
</PRE>

<P>
Then run <B>gnuplot</B> from your command line, and use
"set term x11".

<P>
If you run <B>gnuplot</B> on Unix systems, be sure that the newest
<code>gnuplot_x11</code> is the first in your search path.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00093000000000000000">
7.3 Why does <B>gnuplot</B> ignore my very small numbers?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<B>Gnuplot</B> treats all numbers less than 1e-08 as zero, by default.
Thus, if you are trying to plot a collection of very small
numbers, they may be plotted as zero. Worse, if you're plotting
on a log scale, they will be off scale. Or, if the whole set of
numbers is "zero", your range may be considered empty:

<P>
<PRE>
gnuplot&gt; plot 'test1'
Warning: empty y range [4.047e-19:3e-11], adjusting to [-1:1]
gnuplot&gt; set yrange [4e-19:3e-11]
gnuplot&gt; plot 'test1'
              ^
y range is less than `zero`
</PRE>

<P>
The solution is to change <B>gnuplot</B>'s idea of "zero":
<PRE>
gnuplot&gt; set zero 1e-20
</PRE>

<P>
For more information, "help set zero"

7.4 <B>Gnuplot</B> is plotting nothing when run via <B>gnuplot</B>
	&lt;filename&gt;!  What can I do?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Put a pause -1 after the plot command in the file. On an X-Window System
system, you can also use the <code>-persist</code> option, the X11 window is
then not closed. Close the X11 window by typing "q" when the focus is on
it.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00095000000000000000">
7.5 My formulas are giving me nonsense results! What's going on?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<B>Gnuplot</B> does integer, and not floating point, arithmetic on
integer expressions. For example, the expression 1/3 evaluates
to zero. If you want floating point expressions, supply
trailing dots for your floating point numbers. Example:

<P>
<PRE>
gnuplot&gt; print 1/3
                0
gnuplot&gt; print 1./3.
                0.333333
</PRE>

<P>
This way of evaluating integer expressions is shared by both C and
Fortran.

<P>
Please upgrade to <B>gnuplot</B> 3.7. Some versions of its beta-release had

<P>
The L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X2-core does no longer include the commands
"

7.10 Calling <B>gnuplot</B> in a pipe or with a <B>gnuplot</B>-script
doesn't produce a plot!</A>
</H2>

<P>
You can call <B>gnuplot</B> by using a short Perl-script like the
following:
<PRE>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
open (GP, "|/usr/local/bin/gnuplot -persist") or die "no gnuplot";
# force buffer to flush after each write
use FileHandle;
GP-&gt;autoflush(1);
print GP,"set term x11;plot '/tmp/data.dat' with lines\n";
close GP
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Gnuplot</B> closes its plot window on exit. The <code>close GP</code>
command is executed, and the plot window is closed even before you have
a chance to look at it.

<P>
There are three solutions to this: first, use the <code>pause -1</code>
command in <B>gnuplot</B> before closing the pipe. Second, close the pipe
only if you are sure that you don't need <B>gnuplot</B> and its plot window
anymore. Last, you can use the command line option <code>-persist</code>: this
option leaves the X-Window System plot window open.
